GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

The deployment is failing because the GitHub repository is not properly configured.
Follow these steps to fix the deployment:

1. CREATE A NEW GITHUB REPOSITORY:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository "PersonalWebsite" (without the trailing dash)
   - Make it public or private as desired
   - DO NOT initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. COPY THE REPOSITORY URL:
   - It will look like: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PersonalWebsite.git

3. UPDATE THE REMOTE URL AND PUSH:
   cd c:\Users\tusha\Desktop\Webite
   git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY_URL
   git push -u origin main

4. TRIGGER A NEW DEPLOYMENT ON RENDER:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Trigger a manual deploy or wait for Render to auto-deploy

This should resolve the "No such file or directory" error and allow your application to deploy successfully.
