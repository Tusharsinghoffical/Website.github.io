CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

To push your code to GitHub, you need to:

   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Sign in with your GitHub account (Tusharsinghoffical)
   - Name your repository exactly: "Website.github.io"
   - Make it public
   - DO NOT initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. AFTER CREATING THE REPOSITORY, run these commands:
   cd c:\Users\tusha\Desktop\Webite
   git push -u origin main

The repository must be created under your account (Tusharsinghoffical) to avoid permission issues.
