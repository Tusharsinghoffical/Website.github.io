CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

To fix the deployment issues, you need to create a new GitHub repository:

1. CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Sign in with your GitHub account (Tusharsinghoffical)
   - Name your repository "portfolio-website"
   - Make it public or private as desired
   - DO NOT initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. PUSH YOUR CODE TO THE NEW REPOSITORY:
   cd c:\Users\tusha\Desktop\Webite
   git push -u origin main

3. UPDATE RENDER TO USE THE NEW REPOSITORY:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Update the GitHub repository URL to point to your new repository
   - Trigger a new deployment

This should resolve all the deployment issues you're experiencing.
