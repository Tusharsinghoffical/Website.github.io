GITHUB AUTHENTICATION SETUP
=========================

To push your code to GitHub, you need to:

1. CREATE A PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" (classic)
   - Give it a name like "Portfolio Website"
   - Select scope "repo" (full control of repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - COPY the generated token (you won't see it again)

2. CREATE THE REPOSITORY (if not already created):
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Sign in with your GitHub account (Tusharsinghoffical)
   - Name your repository exactly: "Website.github.io"
   - Make it public
   - DO NOT initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

3. AUTHENTICATE AND PUSH:
   Option A - Update remote URL with token:
   cd c:\Users\tusha\Desktop\Webite
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/Tusharsinghoffical/Website.github.io.git
   git push -u origin main

   Option B - Use GitHub CLI (recommended):
   - Install GitHub CLI from https://cli.github.com/
   - Run: gh auth login
   - Then: cd c:\Users\tusha\Desktop\Webite && git push -u origin main
