GITHUB AUTHENTICATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

The deployment is failing due to authentication issues with GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. CHECK YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY:
   - Go to https://github.com/Tusharsinghoffical
   - Verify if "Website.github.io" repository exists
   - If it doesn't exist, create it:
     * Go to https://github.com/new
     * Name it "Website.github.io"
     * Make it public
     * DO NOT initialize with a README

2. AUTHENTICATE WITH GITHUB:
   Option A - Use Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
   - Update your remote URL with the token:
     git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Tusharsinghoffical/Website.github.io.git

   Option B - Use SSH (recommended):
   - Generate SSH keys if you don't have them
   - Add your SSH key to GitHub
   - Update remote URL to SSH:
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Tusharsinghoffical/Website.github.io.git

3. PUSH YOUR CODE:
   git push -u origin main

This should resolve the permission denied error.
